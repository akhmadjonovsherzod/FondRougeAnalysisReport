Fond Rouge Data Analysis Project

Overview

This repository contains the data analysis project for Fond Rouge, a European luxury brand operating across 15+ cities. The project was conducted using SAP Analytics Cloud to analyze customer sentiment, refund trends, and revenue performance across various global locations, with a particular focus on identifying problem areas in the United States. The analysis leverages datasets covering sentiment scores, refund rates, and revenue contributions to provide actionable insights for improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

The project includes two key documents:

Fond-Rouge-Report.pdf: A detailed report outlining the global and US-specific analysis, including key questions about revenue contributors, order returns, refund-to-revenue ratios, and sentiment scores.

FondRouge.pptx: A presentation summarizing the project overview, key findings, visual insights, and recommendations.

This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, methodology, findings, and instructions for accessing and understanding the materials.

Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis were:

To analyze customer sentiment and refund trends across Fond Rouge's global locations.

To identify the top revenue-contributing locations and areas with high refund rates.

To evaluate the refund-to-revenue ratio to pinpoint operational inefficiencies.

To detect regions with poor customer sentiment and potential issues, such as counterfeit problems in specific US cities (e.g., Los Angeles and Las Vegas).

To provide data-driven recommendations for addressing identified challenges.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

Sentiment Data: Average customer sentiment scores per location, reflecting customer satisfaction.

Refund Data: Number of order returns and refund amounts per location.

Revenue Data: Revenue contributions from each city where Fond Rouge operates.

Geographical Scope: Data from 15+ cities globally, with a focus on key markets like France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, and Switzerland.

The data was processed and visualized using SAP Analytics Cloud, with additional support from data visualization tools to create charts and graphs for the presentation.

Methodology

The analysis was conducted using the following approach:

Data Collection: Aggregated sentiment, refund, and revenue data from Fond Rouge's operations across multiple cities.

Data Processing: Cleaned and structured the dataset within SAP Analytics Cloud to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Analysis:

Identified the top revenue-contributing locations.

Calculated refund-to-revenue ratios to highlight areas with high refund pressure.

Analyzed customer sentiment scores to assess satisfaction levels.

Combined sentiment and refund-to-revenue metrics to identify problem areas, particularly in the US.

Visualization: Created visual insights (e.g., charts, graphs) to illustrate trends and correlations, included in the presentation (FondRouge.pptx).

Reporting: Compiled findings into a detailed report (Fond-Rouge-Report.pdf) addressing key questions such as revenue contributors, high refund locations, and sentiment issues.
